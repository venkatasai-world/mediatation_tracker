# 🧘 Meditation Tracker with Pixela

I always wanted to track my meditation, but often forgot what I did in the morning. That made it hard to remember my progress and stay consistent.  

So, I built my own **Meditation Tracker** using the [Pixela Graph API](https://pixe.la/).  
This project lets me log the number of minutes I meditate each day and see my progress visually in a graph.
